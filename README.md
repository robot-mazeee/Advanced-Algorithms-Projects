This repository contains the solutions to three projects I developed as part of my Algorithms course. Additionally, for each project, I have included:

1) The project description in Portuguese;
2) A Python script I developed (```generate_graph_auto```) to generate a runtime vs. input size graph using Matplotlib and a built-in input generator (not developed by me);
3) A few instances of graphs produced by my generator;
4) An analysis report in Portuguese.
